    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's nothing better than a S'more after a long summer day in the sun. Whether you're at the beach, camping, or just in your backyard, you can't beat this simple treat.</p>
    <p>S'mores are the perfect dessert because they are so easy to make and you can do it pretty much anywhere you have access to open flame. These little devils will have you saying <em>I want s'more of that.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Graham Crackers</li>
        <li>Chocolate Bar</li>
        <li>Marshmallows</li>
        <li>A skewer to roast with</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the mallow on the skewer, roast until golden over an open flame. Or burn it to each their own!</li>
        <li>Once roasted to your liking, place the marshmallow between two graham crackers and a piece of chocolate to make a little sandwich</li>
        <li>and <strong>BOOM</strong> there you have it, one little dessert sandwich sent by the gods themselves.</li>
    </ol>
